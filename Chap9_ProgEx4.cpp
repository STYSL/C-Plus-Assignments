/* Chapter Nine Programming Exercise 4:
Write a program to help a local restaurant automate its breakfast billing system. The program should do the following:  a. Show the customer the different breakfast items offered by the  restaurant.  b. Allow the customer to select more than one item from the menu.  c. Calculate and print the bill. 

Assume that the restaurant offers the following breakfast items  (the price of each item is shown to the right of the item):  Plain Egg $1.45  Bacon and Egg $2.45  Muffin $0.99  French Toast $1.99  Fruit Basket $2.49  Cereal $0.69  Coffee $0.50  Tea $0.75  Use an array menuList of type menuItemType, as defined in Programming Exercise 3. Your program must contain at least the following functions:  ? Function getData: This function loads the data into the array  menuList.  ? Function showMenu: This function shows the different items  offered by the restaurant and tells the user how to select the items.  ? Function printCheck: This function calculates and prints the  check. (Note that the billing amount should include a 5% tax.)  A sample output is:  Welcome to Johnny's Restaurant  Bacon and Egg $2.45  Muffin $0.99  Coffee $0.50  Tax $0.20  Amount Due $4.14  Format your output with two decimal places. The name of each item in  the output must be left justified. You may assume that the user selects  only one item of a particular type.
